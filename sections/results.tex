In this section, we first quantify the uncertainty of least-cost solutions incurred by unknown
future technology cost
and conduct a global sensitivity analysis to set a foundation.
We then expand the uncertainty analysis to the space of nearly cost-optimal solutions,
which yields us insights about the consistency of alternatives across a variety of cost parameters.
Finally, the results are critically discussed.

\subsection{Least-Cost Solutions}

      Distribution of total system cost, generation, storage, and transmission capacities
      for least-cost solutions.
    }
    \label{fig:violin}
\end{SCfigure}

We approach the uncertainty analysis to near-optimal solutions
by reviewing the propagation of input uncertainties into 
least-cost solutions first and expanding gradually from there.
As displayed in \cref{fig:violin},
the total annual system costs vary between 160 and 220 billion Euro per year.
This means the most pessimistic cost projections
entail about 40\% higher cost than the most optimistic projections.
All least-cost solutions build at least 350 GW solar and 600 GW wind, but no more than 1100 GW.
While wind capacities tend towards higher values, solar capacities tend towards lower values.
We observe that least-cost solutions clearly prefer onshore over offshore wind, yet
alongside battery storage onshore wind features the highest uncertainty range.
The cost optimum gravitates towards hydrogen storage rather than battery storage,
unless battery storage becomes very cheap.
There are no least-cost solutions without hydrogen, only some without battery storage.
Transmission network expansion is least affected by cost uncertainty and consistently
doubled compared to today's capacities.
However, the interpretation of the observed ranges is limited because
they are not robust when we look beyond the least-cost solutions and allow marginal cost penalties.
Morover, the distribution of outputs does not yet convey information about their sensitivity to cost assumptions.

    }
    \label{fig:sensitivity}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:sensitivity} addresses a selection of local self-sensitivities, i.e.~how the cost of a technology influences its deployment,
while displaying the remaining uncertainty induced by other cost parameters.
The overall tendency is trivial: the cheaper a technology becomes, the more it is built.
However, changes of slope and effects on uncertainty range across the parameter space are insightful nonetheless.
For instance, \cref{fig:sensitivity} reveals that battery storage becomes significantly more 
attractive economically once its annuity falls below 75 EUR/kW/a, whereas hydrogen storage is
characterised by a steady slope.
A low cost of onshore wind brings about much onshore wind capacity with low uncertainty,
whereas if onshore wind costs are high how much is built greatly depends on other cost parameters.
The opposite is true for offshore wind and solar. 
The limited uncertainty about cost-optimal levels of grid expansion is mostly due to the cost of hydrogen storage.
As the cost of hydrogen storage falls, less grid reinforcment is chosen.
Since the presented self-sensitivities only exhibit a fraction of sensitivities,
in the next step we formalise how input uncertainties affect each outcome by 
systematically with variance-based global sensitivity analysis.

      The total Sobol indices further include interactions with other input variables.
      Total Sobol indices can be greater than 100\% if the contributions are not purely additive.
    }
    \label{fig:sobol}
\end{figure}

Sensitivity indices, or Sobol indices, attribute the observed output variance to each input.
For our application, the Sobol indices can, for instance, tell us which technology cost
contributes the most to total system cost or how much of a specific technology will be built.
The first-order Sobol indices describe the share of output variance
due to variations in one input alone averaged over variations in the other inputs.
Total Sobol indices also consider higher-order interactions,
which are greater than 100\% if the relations are not purely additive.
Sobol indices have been applied in the context of energy systems (e.g. \cite{trondle_trade-offs_2020,mavromatidis_uncertainty_2018})
and we profit from the advantage that we can conveniently compute the indices analytically
from the polynomial chaos expansion \cite{sudret_global_2008}.

\cref{fig:sobol} displays the first-order and total Sobol indices for least-cost solutions.
It shows that the total system cost is largely determined by how expensive it is to build onshore wind capacity,
followed by the cost of hydrogen storage. The amount of wind in the system is 
almost exclusively governed by the cost of onshore and offshore wind parks.
Other carriers yield a more varied picture.
The cost-optimal solar capacities additionally depend on onshore wind and battery costs.
The amount of hydrogen storage is influenced by battery and hydrogen storage cost alike.
Overall, although the first-order effects dominate, there are noticable higher-order effects,
which are largest for the amount of transmission.

\subsection{Near-Optimal Solutions}
%%\blindtext

So far we quantified the output uncertainty and analysed the sensitivity towards inputs at least-cost solutions only.
Yet, it has been previously shown that even for a single cost parameter set a wide array of
technologically diverse but similarly costly solutions exists \cite{nearoptimal}.
In the next step, we examine how technology cost uncertainty affects the outline of near-optimal solutions.  
By identifying feasible alternatives common to all, few or no cost samples, we improve the robustness of the results.

    Space of near-optimal solutions by technology under cost uncertainty.
    For each technology and cost sample,
    the minimum and maximum capacities obtained for increasing cost penalties
    $\varepsilon$ form a cone, starting from a common least-cost solution. 
    By arguments of convexity, the capacity ranges contained by the cone can be near-optimal and and feasible, given a degree of freedom in the other technologies.
    From optimisation theory, we know that the cones widen up for increased slacks.
    As we consider technology cost uncertainty, the cone will look slightly different for each sample.
    The contour lines represent the frequency a solution is inside near-optimal cone over the whole parameter space.
    This is calculated from the overlap of many cones, each representing a set of cost assumptions.
    Due to discrete sampling points in the $\varepsilon$-dimension, the plots further apply quadratic interpolation and gently a Gaussian filter for smoothing.
    }
    \label{fig:fuzzycone}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:fuzzycone} depicts low-cost solutions common to most parameter sets (e.g. above 90\% contour)
as well as system layouts that do not meet low-cost criteria in any circumstances.
The wider the contour lines are apart, the more uncertainty exists about the boundaries.
The closer contour lines are together, the more specific the limits are.
The height of the quantiles quantifies flexibility for a given level of certainty and slack;
the angle presents information about the sensitivity towards cost slack.

From \cref{fig:fuzzycone} we can see that it is 
highly likely that building 900 GW of wind capacity is within 3\% of the optimum, and that
conversely building less than 600 GW has a low chance of being near the cost optimum.
Only a few solutions can forego onshore wind entirely and remain within 8\% of the cost-optimum,
whereas it is very likely possible to build a system without offshore wind at a cost penalty of 4\% at most.
On the other hand, more offshore wind generation is equally possible.
Unlike for onshore wind, where it is more uncertain how little can be built,
uncertainty regarding offshore wind deployment exists about how much can be built
so that costs remain within a pre-specified range.
For solar, the range of options within 8\% of the cost optimum at 90\% certainty is very wide.
Anything between 100 GW and 1000 GW appears feasible.
In comparison to onshore wind, the uncertainty about minimal solar requirements is narrower.
Nonetheless, the level of required transmission expansion is least affected by the cost uncertainty.
To remain within $\varepsilon=8\%$ it is just as possible to
plan for moderate grid reinforcement by 30\% as 
is initiating extensive remodelling of the grid by tripling the transmission volume
compared to what is currently in operation.
These results indicate that in any case some transmission reinforcement
to balance renewable variations across the continent appears to be essential.
Hydrogen storage, symbolising long-term storage, also gives the impression of a vital technology in many cases.
Building 100 GW of hydrogen storage capacity is likely viable within 2\% of the cost optimum 
and, even at $\varepsilon=8\%$, only 25\% of cost samples require no long-term storage; 
cases where battery costs are exceptionally low.
Overall, 90\% of cases appear to function without any short-term battery storage
while the system cost rises by 4\% at most.
However, especially battery storage exhibits a large degree of freedom to build more.

    in two technology dimensions and highlights that the extremes of two technologies from \cref{fig:fuzzycone} cannot be achieved simultaneously.
    }
    \label{fig:dependencies}
\end{figure}

The fuzzy cones from \cref{fig:fuzzycone} assume that the other technologies can be heavily optimised.
But as there are dependencies between the technologies, in \cref{fig:dependencies}
we furthermore present the probabilistic near-optimal space for three selected technology
pairs at fixed $\varepsilon=6\%$ for which we expect the most interesting trade-offs.
It addresses the question about which combinations of wind and solar capacity,
offshore and onshore turbines, and hydrogen and battery storage are likely to be achievable.

First, \cref{fig:dependencies:ws} addresses constraints between wind and solar.
The upper right boundary exists because building much of both wind and solar would bee too expensive.
The absence of solutions in the bottom left corner means that
building too little of any wind or solar does not suffice to produce enough electricity.
From the shape and contours, we see a high chance
that building 1000 GW of wind and 400 GW of solar is within 6\% of the cost-optimum.
On the other hand, building less than 200 GW of solar and 600 GW of wind is unlikely to yield a low-cost solution.
Minimising the capacity of both primal energy sources will shift capacity installations to
high-yield locations even if additional network expansion is necessary and boost
the preference for highly efficient storage technologies.
Overall, even considering combinations of wind and solar,
a wide space of low-cost options exists with moderate to high likelihood,
although the range of alternatives is shown to be more constrained.

\cref{fig:dependencies:oo} concerns the trade-off between onshore wind and offshore wind.
The most certain area is characterised by building more than 600 GW onshore wind,
and less than 250 GW offshore wind capacity.
However, there are some solutions with high substitutability between onshore and offshore wind,
shown in the upper left of the contour plot.
Compared to wind and solar, the range of near-optimal solutions is more constrained.
Finally, \cref{fig:dependencies:hb} underlines that some storage is definitely needed,
50 GW of each at least in any case. Highest likelihoods are attained when building 150 GW of each.

\end{figure}

Neither of the aforementioned contour plots (\crefrange{fig:fuzzycone}{fig:dependencies}) expose
what changes the system layout experiences when reaching for the extremes in one technology.
Therefore, we show in \cref{fig:nearviolin} how the system-wide capacity distributions vary 
compared to the least-cost solutions (\cref{fig:violin}) for two exemplary alternative objectives.
For that, we chose minimising onshore wind capacity and transmission expansion
because they are often linked to public opposition.

\cref{fig:nearviolin:onwind} illustrates that reducing onshore wind capacity is
predominantly compensated by increased offshore wind generation but also added solar capacities.
The increased focus on offshore wind also leads to a tendency towards more hydrogen storage,
while transmission expansion levels are similarly distributed as for the least-cost solutions.
From \cref{fig:nearviolin:transmission} we can further extract that avoiding transmission expansion entails
more hydrogen storage that compensates balancing in space with balancing in time,
and more generation capacity overall, where resources are distributed to locations with
high demand but weaker capacity factors and more heavily curtailed.

\subsection{Critical Appraisal and Outlook}
%%\blindtext

Reconstruction and Disaggregation
- When using the surrogate model we do not get the full original model outputs.
- If we are interested in spatially explicit outcomes, we can either take one of the samples
or reconstruct selectively by adding the aggregate outcomes as additional constraints to the full model.

no sector-coupling

no path dependencies and multi-period investments

endogenous learning
- These cheap areas should then be targeted with policy (e.g. drive technology learning by subsidies)
- smoothly leads up to future work with endogenous learning in multi-horizon investment planning!
- embed technological learning in optimisation \cite{heuberger_power_2017} \cite{lopion_cost_2019}, remaining uncertainty of learning rate, but "learning by doing" included

further uncertain input parameters:
- rountrip efficiency of hydrogen storage

richer set of technologies?
- solar thermal, nuclear, CAES, separate hydrogen storage to fuel cell, biomass, geothermal, electrolysis, gas turbine
