In this section, we approach the uncertainty analysis to near-optimal solutions
by reviewing the propagation of input uncertainties into least-cost solutions
first and expanding gradually from there. This includes inspecting cost and
capacity distributions induced by unknown future technology cost and conducting
a global sensitivity analysis that identifies the most influential cost
parameters for least-cost solutions. We then expand the uncertainty analysis to
the space of nearly cost-optimal solutions, which yields us insights about the
consistency of near-optimal alternatives across a variety of cost parameters.

\subsection{Cost and Capacity Distribution of Least-Cost Solutions}

\begin{SCfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{violins/violin-capacities-high-prediction.pdf}
    \caption{
      Distribution of total system cost, generation, storage, and transmission capacities
      for least-cost solutions.
    }
    \label{fig:violin}
\end{SCfigure}

Based on the uncertainty of cost inputs, the total annual system costs vary
between 160 and 220 billion Euro per year, as displayed in \cref{fig:violin}.
This means the most pessimistic cost projections entail about 40\% higher cost
than the most optimistic projections. All least-cost solutions build at least
350 GW solar and 600 GW wind, but no more than 1100 GW. While wind capacities
tend towards higher values, solar capacities tend towards lower values. We
observe that least-cost solutions clearly prefer onshore over offshore wind, yet
onshore wind features the highest uncertainty range alongside battery storage.
The cost optimum gravitates towards hydrogen storage rather than battery storage
unless battery storage becomes very cheap. There are no least-cost solutions
without hydrogen, only some without battery storage. Transmission network
expansion is least affected by cost uncertainty and consistently doubled
compared to today's capacities. The question arises, what we can conclude from
these insights. The interpretation of the observed ranges may be limited because
they are not robust when we look beyond the least-cost solutions and acknowledge
structural modelling uncertainties, such as social constraints. Moreover, the
pure distribution of outputs does not yet convey information about how sensitive
results are to particular cost assumptions. But knowing the technologies for
which lowering overnight costs has a significant impact is important to promote
technological learning in that direction.

\subsection{Parameter Sweeps and Global Sensitivity Indices}

\cref{fig:sensitivity} addresses a selection of local self-sensitivities,
i.e.~how the cost of a technology influences its deployment while displaying the
remaining uncertainty induced by other cost parameters. The overall tendency is
easily explained: the cheaper a technology becomes, the more it is built.
However, changes of slope and effects on the uncertainty range as one cost
parameter is swept are insightful nonetheless. For instance,
\cref{fig:sensitivity} reveals that battery storage becomes significantly more
% TODO convert to overnight cost
attractive economically once its annuity falls below 75 EUR/kW/a (including 6h
energy capacity at full power output) hydrogen storage features a steady slope.
A low cost of onshore wind makes building much onshore wind capacity attractive
with low uncertainty, whereas if onshore wind costs are high how much is built
greatly depends on other cost parameters.
The opposite behaviour is observed for offshore wind and solar. 
The cost of hydrogen storage mostly causes the limited uncertainty about cost-optimal levels of grid expansion.
As the cost of hydrogen storage falls, less grid reinforcement is chosen.
But since the presented self-sensitivities only exhibit a fraction of all sensitivities,
in the next step we formalise how input uncertainties affect each outcome 
systematically by applying variance-based global sensitivity analysis techniques, which
have been applied in the context of energy systems e.g.~in \cite{trondle_trade-offs_2020,mavromatidis_uncertainty_2018}.



Sensitivity indices, or Sobol indices, attribute the observed output variance to each input and
can be computed analytically from the polynomial chaos expansion \cite{sudret_global_2008}.
For our application, the Sobol indices can, for instance, tell us which technology cost
contributes the most to total system cost or how much of a specific technology will be built.
The first-order Sobol indices describe the share of output variance
due to variations in one input alone averaged over variations in the other inputs.
Total Sobol indices also consider higher-order interactions,
which are greater than 100\% if the relations are not purely additive.

The first-order and total Sobol indices for least-cost solutions in
\cref{fig:sobol} show that the total system cost is largely determined by how
expensive it is to build onshore wind capacity, followed by the cost of hydrogen
storage. The amount of wind in the system is almost exclusively governed by the
cost of onshore and offshore wind parks. Other carriers yield a more varied
picture. The cost-optimal solar capacities additionally depend on onshore wind
and battery costs. The amount of hydrogen storage is influenced by battery and
hydrogen storage cost alike.  Although there are noticeable higher-order
effects, which are most extensive for transmission, the first-order effects
dominate. Strikingly, the volume of transmission network expansion strongly
depends on the cost of hydrogen storage, which can be explained by the synoptic
spatio-temporal scale of wind power variability across the European continent
which both hydrogen storage and transmission networks seek to balance from
different angles. While hydrogen storage typically balances multi-week
variations in time, continent-spanning transmission networks exploit the
circumstance that as weather systems traverse the continent, it is likely always
to be windy somewhere in Europe.

\subsection{Fuzzy Near-Optimal Corridors with Increasing Cost Slack}

So far, we quantified the output uncertainty and analysed the sensitivity
towards inputs at least-cost solutions only. Yet, it has been previously shown
that even for a single cost parameter set a wide array of technologically
diverse but similarly costly solutions exists \cite{nearoptimal}. In the next
step, we examine how technology cost uncertainty affects the shape of the space
of near-optimal solutions.  

By identifying feasible alternatives common to all, few or no cost samples, we
outline low-cost solutions common to most parameter sets (e.g. above 90\%
contour) as well as system layouts that do not meet low-cost criteria in any
circumstances for varying $\epsilon$ in \cref{fig:fuzzycone}. The wider the
displayed contour lines are apart, the more uncertainty exists about the
boundaries. The closer contour lines are together, the more specific the limits
are. The height of the quantiles quantifies flexibility for a given level of
certainty and slack; the angle presents information about the sensitivity
towards cost slack.

    \caption{
    Space of near-optimal solutions by technology under cost uncertainty.
    For each technology and cost sample,
    the minimum and maximum capacities obtained for increasing cost penalties
    $\epsilon$ form a cone, starting from a common least-cost solution. 
    By arguments of convexity, the capacity ranges contained by the cone can be near-optimal and feasible, given a degree of freedom in the other technologies.
    From optimisation theory, we know that the cones widen up for increased slacks.
    As we consider technology cost uncertainty, the cone will look slightly different for each sample.
    The contour lines represent the frequency a solution is inside the near-optimal cone over the whole parameter space.
    This is calculated from the overlap of many cones, each representing a set of cost assumptions.
    Due to discrete sampling points in the $\epsilon$-dimension, the plots further apply quadratic interpolation and a Gaussian filter for smoothing.
    }
    \label{fig:fuzzycone}
\end{figure}

From the fuzzy upper and lower Pareto fronts in \cref{fig:fuzzycone} we can see that it is 
highly likely that building 900 GW of wind capacity is possible within 3\% of the optimum, and that
conversely building less than 600 GW has a low chance of being near the cost optimum.
Only a few solutions can forego onshore wind entirely and remain within 8\% of the cost-optimum,
whereas it is very likely possible to build a system without offshore wind at a cost penalty of 4\% at most.
On the other hand, more offshore wind generation is equally possible.
Unlike for onshore wind, where it is more uncertain how little can be built,
uncertainty regarding offshore wind deployment exists about how much can be built
so that costs remain within a pre-specified range.
For solar, the range of options within 8\% of the cost optimum at 90\% certainty is very wide.
Anything between 100 GW and 1000 GW appears feasible.
In comparison to onshore wind, the uncertainty about minimal solar requirements is smaller.

The level of required transmission expansion is least affected by the cost uncertainty.
To remain within $\epsilon=8\%$ it is just as likely possible to
plan for moderate grid reinforcement by 30\% as 
is initiating extensive remodelling of the grid by tripling the transmission volume
compared to what is currently in operation.
These results indicate that in any case some transmission reinforcement
to balance renewable variations across the continent appears to be essential.
Hydrogen storage, symbolising long-term storage, also gives the impression of a vital technology in many cases.
Building 100 GW of hydrogen storage capacity is likely viable within 2\% of the cost optimum 
and, even at $\epsilon=8\%$, only 25\% of cost samples require no long-term storage; 
when battery costs are exceptionally low.
Overall, 90\% of cases appear to function without any short-term battery storage
while the system cost rises by 4\% at most.
However, especially battery storage exhibits a large degree of freedom to build more.

    in two technology dimensions and highlights that the extremes of two technologies from \cref{fig:fuzzycone} cannot be achieved simultaneously.
    }
    \label{fig:dependencies}
\end{figure}

The fuzzy cones from \cref{fig:fuzzycone} look at trade-offs between system cost
and single techologies, assuming that the other technologies can be heavily
optimised. But as there are dependencies between the technologies, in
\cref{fig:dependencies} we furthermore evaluate trade-offs between technologies
for three selected pairs at fixed system cost increase of $\epsilon=6\%$,
addressing which \textit{combinations} of wind and solar
capacity, offshore and onshore turbines, and hydrogen and battery storage are
likely to be cost-efficient.

First, \cref{fig:dependencies:ws} addresses constraints between wind and solar.
The upper right boundary exists because building much of both wind and solar
would be too expensive. The absence of solutions in the bottom left corner
means that building too little of any wind or solar does not suffice to generate
enough electricity. From the shape and contours, we see a high chance that
building 1000 GW of wind \textit{and} 400 GW of solar is within 6\% of the
cost-optimum. On the other hand, building less than 200 GW of solar and 600 GW
of wind is unlikely to yield a low-cost solution. In general, minimising the
capacity of both primal energy sources will shift capacity installations to
high-yield locations even if additional network expansion is necessary and boost
the preference for highly efficient storage technologies. Overall, we can take
away from this that, even considering combinations of wind and solar, a wide
space of low-cost options exists with moderate to high likelihood, although the
range of alternatives is shown to be more constrained.

The trade-off between onshore wind and offshore wind is illustrated in
\cref{fig:dependencies:oo}. Here, the most certain area is characterised by
building more than 600 GW onshore wind, and less than 250 GW offshore wind
capacity. However, there are some solutions with high substitutability between
onshore and offshore wind, shown in the upper left bulge of the contour plot.
Compared to wind and solar, the range of near-optimal solutions is even more
constrained. The key role of energy storage in a fully renewable system is
underlined in \cref{fig:dependencies:hb}. Around 50 GW of each is at least
needed in any case, while highest likelihoods are attained when building 150 GW
of each.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Capacity Distributions at Minimal Onshore Wind and Transmission Grid}

The aforementioned contour plots \crefrange{fig:fuzzycone}{fig:dependencies} outline
what is likely possible within specified cost ranges and subject to technology cost uncertainty,
but do not expose
the changes the overall system layout experiences when reaching for the extremes in one technology.
Therefore, we show in \cref{fig:nearviolin} how the system-wide capacity distributions vary 
compared to the least-cost solutions (\cref{fig:violin}) for two exemplary alternative objectives.
For that, we chose minimising onshore wind capacity and transmission expansion
because they are often linked to social acceptance issues.

\cref{fig:nearviolin:onwind} illustrates that reducing onshore wind capacity is
predominantly compensated by increased offshore wind generation but also added solar capacities.
The increased focus on offshore wind also leads to a tendency towards more hydrogen storage,
while transmission expansion levels are similarly distributed as for the least-cost solutions.
From \cref{fig:nearviolin:transmission} we can further extract that avoiding transmission expansion entails
more hydrogen storage that compensates balancing in space with balancing in time,
and more generation capacity overall, where resources are distributed to locations with
high demand but weaker capacity factors and more heavily curtailed.

\subsection{Critical Appraisal}

The need to solve models for many cost projections and near-optimal search
directions in reasonable time means that compromises had to be made in other
modelling dimensions. For instance, the analysis would profit from a richer set
of technologies and further uncertain input parameters, including efficiencies
of fuel cells and electrolysis or the consideration of concentrating solar
power, geothermal energy, biomass, and nuclear to name just a few. But as the
number of considered technologies and parameters rises, so does the
computational burden. Given the already considerable computational efforts
involved in procuring our results, considering the full breadth of technologies
and uncertainties would not have been feasible with the computational resources
available. Moreover, limitations apply to the scope of the analysis which is
limited to the electricity sector does not consider coupling to other energy
sectors. However, accounting for interactions across sectors at high resolution
in similarly set future studies is desirable and in development. Additionally,
we assess no path dependencies via multi-period investments and endogenous
learning, but optimise for an emission reduction in a particular target year
based on annualised costs. We further disregard interannual variations of
weather data by basing the analysis just on a single weather year for computational
reasons. Lastly, aspects such as reserves, system adequacy and inertia have not
been considered.
