There's neither a unique nor a certain path to cost-efficiency.

within 8\% of least-cost solution and given investment cost uncertainties

substantial RANGE OF OPTIONS regardless how cost developments will unfold
- across all technologies individually
- and in pairs (wind+solar etc., but more constrained)

a few BOUNDARY CONDITIONS robust despite cost uncertainty
- need at least 600 GW wind
- transmission expansion by 30\%
- some storage, particularly long-term

the KEY DRIVERS of uncertainty in system cost and composition
- most pessimistic cost set is about 40\% more expensive than optimistic cost set (in comparison the allowed cost slack seems small)
- onshore wind cost appears as main determinant of system cost, but can often be substituted with offshore wind for small cost penalty
- once battery costs fall below 75EUR/kW/a, much battery deployment, whereas transmission not sensitive

% in principle these results are the same as for the previous near-optimal paper,
% but now proven to be robust towards technology cost uncertainty
