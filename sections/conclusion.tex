span a space of options for society and politics to work with beyond least-cost
enable social trade-offs, navigate around / circumvent issues
Within 8\% of least-cost solution and given investment cost uncertainties,
there is no unique path to cost-efficiency.

substantial range of options regardless how cost developments will unfold
- across all technologies individually
- and in pairs (wind+solar etc., but more constrained)

a few boundary conditions robust despite cost uncertainty
- need at least 600 GW wind
- transmission expansion by 30\%
- some storage, particularly long-term

the key drivers of uncertainty in system cost and composition
- most pessimistic cost set is about 40\% more expensive than optimistic cost set (in comparison the allowed cost slack seems small)
- onshore wind cost appears as main determinant of system cost, but can often be substituted with offshore wind for small cost penalty
- once battery costs fall below 75EUR/kW/a, much battery deployment, whereas transmission not sensitive

when commissioning a study policymakers should always ask for a range of choices
