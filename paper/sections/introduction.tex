% context and motivation

Energy system models have become a pivotal instrument for policy-making to find
cost-efficient system layouts that satisfy ambitious climate change mitigation
targets. But even though they have proliferated in spatial, temporal,
technological and sectoral detail and scope in recent years, least-cost
optimisation models can easily give a false sense of exactness
\cite{Trutnevyte2016, pye_modelling_2020}. Frequently, they present just a
single least-cost solution for a single set of cost assumptions, which not only
neglects uncertainties inherent to technology cost projections which can have a
strong effect on the results of capacity expansion models
\cite{trondle_trade-offs_2020, yue_review_2018, pye_assessing_2018}, but also
hides a wide array of alternative solutions that are equally feasible and only
marginally more expensive \cite{nearoptimal, lombardi_policy_2020,
sasse_regional_2020}.

% relevance of trade-offs

Trade-offs revealed by deviating from least-cost solutions are extremely
attractive for policymakers, because they allow them to make decisions based on
non-economic criteria without affecting the cost-effectiveness of the system.
Knowing that many similarly costly but technologically diverse solutions exist,
helps to accommodate political and social dimensions that are otherwise hard to
quantify; for instance, rising public opposition towards new transmission
lines and onshore wind turbines or an uneven distribution of new infrastructure
\cite{mccollum_energy_2020,sasse_regional_2020,schlachtberger_cost_2018}.

% how to find trade-offs

Techniques like multi-objective optimisation and
modelling-to-generate-alternatives are designed to find such near-optimal
solutions. They have been applied to investment planning models of
the European \cite{nearoptimal}, the Italian
\cite{lombardi_policy_2020}, and the United States power system
\cite{DeCarolis2016}, pathways to decarbonise the power system of the United
Kingdom \cite{Li2017}, a single-node sector-coupling model of Germany
\cite{nacken_integrated_2019}, global integrated assessment models
\cite{Price2017}, and were combined with a quick hull algorithm to span a
polytope of low-cost solutions for a single set of cost parameters
\cite{pedersen_modeling_2020}.

% trade-offs must be robust to cost uncertainty

However, most of the studies above only use a central cost projection for each
considered technology. Recent decades have shown that many of these
projections contain a high level of uncertainty, particularly for fast-moving
technologies like solar, wind, batteries and hydrogen storage
\cite{ludererImpactDeclining2021,victoriaSolarPhotovoltaics2021,jaxa-rozenSourcesUncertainty2021}. This
uncertainty propagates through the model to strongly affect the optimal and
near-optimal system compositions, thus undermining any analysis of the
trade-offs. Hence, it is crucial that apparent compromises are rigorously tested
for robustness to technology cost uncertainty to raise confidence in conclusions
about viable, cost-effective power system designs. To thoroughly sweep this
uncertainty space, we can avail of previous works on
multi-dimensional global sensitivity analysis techniques in the context of
least-cost optimisation \cite{trondle_trade-offs_2020,
mavromatidis_uncertainty_2018, pizarro-alonso_uncertainties_2019,
fais_impact_2016, usher_value_2015}.

% this work / novelty

In this paper, for the first time, we bring together near-optimal analysis with
global sensitivity sweeps over uncertainty. This allows us to systematically
explore robust trade-offs near the cost-optimum of a fully renewable European
electricity system model, PyPSA-Eur \cite{pypsaeur}, and investigate how they
are affected by uncertain technology cost projections. We evaluate compromise
solutions between system cost and technology choices by minimising and
maximising the use of on- and offshore wind, solar photovoltaics, transmission,
batteries and hydrogen storage respectively in order to identify near-optimal
alternatives that are no more than 8\% more expensive than the least-cost
option. This discretionary choice is low enough to argue that such solutions are
nearly cost-optimal, and high enough such that most trade-offs have flattened
out at this point. Given a fixed allowed cost penalty of 6\%, we also analyse
trade-offs for pairs of technologies; namely between wind and solar, battery and
hydrogen storage, and offshore and onshore wind. For this research, we solve
numerous spatially and temporally explicit long-term investment planning
problems that coordinate generation, transmission and storage investments
subject to multi-period linear optimal power flow constraints. The capacity
optimisation is supplemented with global sensitivity analysis methods to account
for a wide range of cost projections for wind, solar, battery and hydrogen
storage technologies. These cost projections are assumed to be uniformly
distributed based on ranges from the Danish Energy Agency for the year 2050
\cite{DEA}.

% computational achievement

To handle the high computational burden incurred by searching for near-optimal
alternatives alongside evaluating many different cost parameter sets, we employ
multi-fidelity surrogate modelling techniques, based on sparse polynomial chaos
expansion, that allow us to merge results from one simpler and another more
detailed model. One covers 37 regions at 4-hourly and the other 128 regions at
2-hourly resolution over a full year. This approach has been proven very
effective in Tr√∂ndle et al.~\cite{trondle_trade-offs_2020}. Heavy
parallelisation with high-performance computing infrastructure allows us to
solve more than 50,000 resource-intensive optimisation problems which, in
combination with surrogate modelling, can span a probabilistic space of
near-optimal solutions rather than putting single scenarios into the foreground.

% results

Thereby, we are able to present alternative solutions beyond least-cost that
have a high chance of involving a limited cost increase, just as we identify
regions that are unlikely to be cost-efficient. We derive both ranges of options
and technology-specific boundary conditions that are not affected by cost
uncertainty and must be met to keep the total system cost within a specified
range. Our results show that indeed many such similarly costly but
technologically diverse solutions exist regardless of how technology cost
developments will unfold within the considered ranges.

We approach the presentation of these results in two steps: we first show the
propagation of uncertainties in least-cost solutions, including a global
sensitivity analysis that identifies the most influential cost parameters. We
then gradually expand the uncertainty analysis to the space of nearly
cost-optimal solutions.
