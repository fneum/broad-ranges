    \label{fig:violin}
\end{figure}

Based on the uncertainty of cost inputs, the total annual system costs vary
between 160 and 220 billion Euro per year, as displayed in \cref{fig:violin}.
This means the most pessimistic cost projections entail about 40\% higher cost
than the most optimistic projections. All least-cost solutions build at least
350 GW solar and 600 GW wind, but no more than 1100 GW. While wind capacities
tend towards higher values, solar capacities tend towards lower values. We
observe that least-cost solutions clearly prefer onshore over offshore wind, yet
onshore wind features the highest uncertainty range alongside battery storage.
The cost optimum gravitates towards hydrogen storage rather than battery storage
unless battery storage becomes very cheap. There are no least-cost solutions
without hydrogen, only some without battery storage. Transmission network
expansion is least affected by cost uncertainty and consistently doubled
compared to today's capacities. Although these results outline the extent to
which cost uncertainty affects cost-optimal designs, the insights from the
observed ranges are limited because they are not robust when we look beyond the
least-cost solutions and acknowledge structural modelling uncertainties, such as
social constraints to the expansion of grids and wind turbines. Moreover, the
pure distribution of outputs does not yet convey information about how sensitive
results are to particular cost assumptions. But knowing the technologies for
which lowering overnight costs has a significant impact is important to promote
technological learning in that direction.

\usection{Local Parameter Sweeps and Global Sensitivity Indices}{sec:sub:sobol}

Therefore, \cref{fig:sensitivity} expands the previous view by showing how the
cost of a technology influences its deployment while displaying the remaining
uncertainty induced by other cost parameters. The overall tendency is easily
explained: the cheaper a technology becomes, the more it is built. However,
changes of slope and effects on the uncertainty range as one cost parameter is
swept are insightful nonetheless. For instance, \cref{fig:sensitivity} reveals
that battery storage becomes significantly more attractive economically once its
annuity falls below 75 EUR/kW/a (including 6h energy capacity at full power
output) hydrogen storage features a steady slope. A low cost of onshore wind
makes building much onshore wind capacity attractive with low uncertainty,
whereas if onshore wind costs are high how much is built greatly depends on
other cost parameters. The opposite behaviour is observed for offshore wind and
solar. The cost of hydrogen storage mostly causes the limited uncertainty about
cost-optimal levels of grid expansion. As the cost of hydrogen storage falls,
less grid reinforcement is chosen.

But since the presented sensitivity of capacities towards their own cost only
exhibit a fraction of all sensitivities, we further apply a more systematic a
variance-based global sensitivity analysis, which have been applied in energy
systems analysis e.g.~in
\cite{trondle_trade-offs_2020,mavromatidis_uncertainty_2018}. Sensitivity
indices, or Sobol indices, attribute the observed output variance to each input
\cite{sudret_global_2008}. For our application, the Sobol indices can, for
instance, tell us which technology cost contributes the most to total system
cost or how much of a specific technology will be built. The first-order Sobol
indices describe the share of output variance due to variations in one input
alone averaged over variations in the other inputs. Total Sobol indices also
consider higher-order interactions, which are greater than 100\% if the
relations are not purely additive or independent.

The first-order and total Sobol indices for least-cost solutions in
\cref{fig:sobol} show that the total system cost is largely determined by how
expensive it is to build onshore wind capacity, followed by the cost of hydrogen
storage. The amount of wind in the system is almost exclusively governed by the
cost of onshore and offshore wind parks. Other carriers yield a more varied
picture. The cost-optimal solar capacities additionally depend on onshore wind
and battery costs. The amount of hydrogen storage is influenced by battery and
hydrogen storage cost alike. Although there are noticeable higher-order effects,
which are most extensive for transmission, the first-order effects dominate.
Strikingly, the volume of transmission network expansion strongly depends on the
cost of hydrogen storage, which can be explained by the synoptic spatio-temporal
scale of wind power variability across the European continent which both
hydrogen storage and transmission networks can balance. While hydrogen storage
typically balances multi-week variations in time, continent-spanning
transmission networks exploit the circumstance that as weather systems traverse
the continent, it is likely always to be windy somewhere in Europe.

\usection{Fuzzy Near-Optimal Corridors with Increasing Cost Slack}{sec:sub:fuzzy}

So far, we quantified the output uncertainty and analysed the sensitivity
towards inputs at least-cost solutions only. Yet, it has been previously shown
that even for a single cost parameter set a wide array of technologically
diverse but similarly costly solutions exists \cite{nearoptimal}. Hence, we now
examine how technology cost uncertainty affects the shape of the space of
near-optimal solutions.

By identifying feasible alternatives common to all, few or no cost samples, we
outline low-cost solutions common to most parameter sets (e.g. above 90\%
contour) as well as system layouts that do not meet low-cost criteria under
nearly no circumstances for varying $\epsilon$ in \cref{fig:fuzzycone}. For each
technology and cost sample, the minimum and maximum capacities obtained for
increasing cost penalties $\epsilon$ form a cone of an upper and a lower Pareto
front, starting from a common least-cost solution. These Pareto fronts delineate
boundaries beyond which no criterion, neither reducing system cost nor
extremising the capacity of a technology, can be improved without depressing the
other. By arguments of convexity, the capacity ranges contained by the cone can
be near-optimal and feasible, given a degree of freedom in the other
technologies. From optimisation theory, we know that the cones widen up for
increased slacks. As we consider technology cost uncertainty, the cone will look
slightly different for each sample causing the fuzziness of the boundaries. The
contour lines represent the frequency a solution is inside the near-optimal cone
over the whole parameter space. This is calculated from the overlap of many
cones, each representing a set of cost assumptions. The wider the displayed
contour lines are apart, the more uncertainty exists about the boundaries. The
closer contour lines are together, the more specific the limits are. The height
of the quantiles quantifies flexibility for a given level of certainty and
slack; the angle presents information about the sensitivity towards cost slack.

    \label{fig:fuzzycone}
\end{figure}

From the fuzzy upper and lower Pareto fronts in \cref{fig:fuzzycone} it can be
seen that building 900 GW of wind capacity is highly likely possible within 3\%
of the optimum, and that conversely building less than 600 GW has a low chance
of being near the cost optimum. Only a few solutions can forego onshore wind
entirely and remain within 8\% of the cost-optimum, whereas it is very likely
possible to build a system without offshore wind at a cost penalty of 4\% at
most. On the other hand, more offshore wind generation is equally possible.
Unlike for onshore wind, where it is more uncertain how little can be built,
uncertainty regarding offshore wind deployment exists about how much can be
built so that costs remain within a pre-specified range. For solar, the range of
options within 8\% of the cost optimum at 90\% certainty is very wide. Anything
between 100 GW and 1000 GW appears feasible as long as other substituting
technologies are built and suitably sited. In comparison to onshore wind, the
uncertainty about minimal solar requirements is smaller.

The level of required transmission expansion is least affected by the cost uncertainty.
To remain within $\epsilon=8\%$ it is just as likely feasible to
plan for moderate grid reinforcement by 30\% as
is initiating extensive remodelling of the grid by tripling the transmission volume
compared to what is currently in operation.
These results indicate that in any case some transmission reinforcement
to balance renewable variations across the continent appears to be essential.
Hydrogen storage, symbolising long-term storage, also gives the impression of a vital technology in many cases.
Building 100 GW of hydrogen storage capacity is likely viable within 2\% of the cost optimum
and, even at $\epsilon=8\%$, only 25\% of cost samples require no long-term storage;
when battery costs are exceptionally low.
Overall, 90\% of cases appear to function without any short-term battery storage
while the system cost rises by 4\% at most.
However, especially battery storage exhibits a large degree of freedom to build more.

    }
    \label{fig:dependencies}
\end{figure}

The fuzzy cones from \cref{fig:fuzzycone} look at trade-offs between system cost
and single techologies, assuming that the siting and deployment of other
technologies can be heavily optimised. But as there are dependencies between the
technologies, in \crefrange{fig:dependencies:ws}{fig:dependencies:hb} we
furthermore evaluate trade-offs between technologies for three selected pairs at
fixed system cost increase of $\epsilon=6\%$, addressing which
\textit{combinations} of wind and solar capacity, offshore and onshore turbines,
and hydrogen and battery storage are likely to be cost-efficient.

First, \cref{fig:dependencies:ws} addresses constraints between wind and solar.
The upper right boundary exists because building much of both wind and solar
would be too expensive. The absence of solutions in the bottom left corner means
that building too little of any wind or solar does not suffice to generate
enough electricity. From the shape and contours, we see a high chance that
building 1000 GW of wind \textit{and} 400 GW of solar is within 6\% of the
cost-optimum. On the other hand, building less than 200 GW of solar and 600 GW
of wind is unlikely to yield a low-cost solution. In general, minimising the
capacity of both primal energy sources will shift capacity installations to
high-yield locations even if additional network expansion is necessary and boost
the preference for highly efficient storage technologies. Overall, we can
conclude from this that, even considering combinations of wind and solar, a wide
space of low-cost options exists with moderate to high likelihood, although the
range of alternatives is shown to be more constrained.

The trade-off between onshore wind and offshore wind is illustrated in
\cref{fig:dependencies:oo}. Here, the most certain area is characterised by
building more than 600 GW onshore wind, and less than 250 GW offshore wind
capacity. However, there are some solutions with high substitutability between
onshore and offshore wind, shown in the upper left bulge of the contour plot.
Compared to wind and solar, the range of near-optimal solutions is even more
constrained. The key role of energy storage in a fully renewable system is
underlined in \cref{fig:dependencies:hb}. Around 50 GW of each is at least
needed in any case, while highest likelihoods are attained when building 150 GW
of each.

\usection{Capacity Distributions at Minimal Onshore Wind and Transmission Grid}{sec:sub:dist2}

The aforementioned contour plots \crefrange{fig:fuzzycone}{fig:dependencies} outline
what is likely possible within specified cost ranges and subject to technology cost uncertainty,
but do not expose
the changes the overall system layout experiences when reaching for the extremes in one technology.
Therefore, we show in \crefrange{fig:nearviolin:onwind}{fig:nearviolin:transmission} how the system-wide capacity distributions vary
compared to the least-cost solutions (\cref{fig:violin}) for two exemplary alternative objectives.
For that, we choose the scenarios with least onshore wind capacity and least transmission expansion
because they are often linked to social acceptance issues.

\cref{fig:nearviolin:onwind} illustrates that reducing onshore wind capacity is
predominantly compensated for by increased offshore wind generation but also added solar capacities.
The increased focus on offshore wind also leads to a tendency towards more hydrogen storage,
while transmission expansion levels are similarly distributed as for the least-cost solutions.
From \cref{fig:nearviolin:transmission} we can further extract that avoiding transmission expansion entails
more hydrogen storage that compensates balancing in space with balancing in time,
and more generation capacity overall, where resources are distributed to locations with
high demand but weaker capacity factors and more heavily curtailed.
